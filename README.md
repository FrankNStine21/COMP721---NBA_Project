# COMP721---NBA_Project
The final project for COMP721 (2022) - Outstanding player detection and game outcome prediction using Machine Learning approaches

Some notes on running the project:
  1. Run either the K-Means or KNN block to define the methods before running the "Running outlier Detection" block.
  2. See the project report for a detailed overview.
  3. Since Colab was used for this notebook, you may have to change the file locations.
